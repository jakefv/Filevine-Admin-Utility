# Filevine Admin Utility
A chrome extension that creates shortcuts for Filevine Adminstrators.

The Filevine Admin Utility is a shoddily produced, undoubtedly buggy Google Chrome extension that hopefully reduces the number of clicks Filevine staff members have to perform day-to-day.

## Installation

1. [Download the unpacked extension](https://github.com/jakefv/FV-Admin-Toolbar/archive/master.zip)
2. Navigate to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)
3. While in Filevine, click on the blue puzzle piece icon in the top right to open the popup menu
